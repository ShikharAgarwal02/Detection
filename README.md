Object Detection and Tracking
Project Overview
This project is part of my CodeAlpha internship in Artificial Intelligence, where I developed a robust object detection and tracking system using TensorFlow Hub. The primary goal of this project is to identify and track multiple objects in real-time, providing significant potential for applications in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and various other fields.

Key Features
High Accuracy Detection: Utilizes TensorFlow Hub's pre-trained models for accurate object detection.
Real-Time Performance: Capable of processing and detecting objects in real-time.
Multi-Object Tracking: Tracks multiple objects across frames, ensuring consistent identification.
Technology Stack
TensorFlow: For loading and using the pre-trained object detection models.
TensorFlow Hub: To access and integrate advanced object detection models.
OpenCV: For image processing and visualization of detection results.
Google Colab: To provide an interactive and collaborative environment for running the project.
